# Assign (or infer) ancestry for non overlapping markers
- Based on the segments between two overlapping markers
- Case 1: two haplotype segments on the same ancestry
  - Just assign that ancestry (easy!)
- Case 2: two different ancestry
  - Figure out phasing info of the overlapping markers and non overlapping ones
  - Assign ancestry based on overlapping one on the same haplotype
- Case 3: "mosaic" ancestry on one of the haplotype segment
  - Figure out phasing info of the overlapping markers and non overlapping ones
  - Assign ancestry based on the distance?
- Case 4: "mosaic" ancestry on both haplotype segments
  - Kill me...
